Semantic HTML
=============

### Problem 1. Refactoring
*	Refactor (edit) the [1-refactoring.html](https://github.com/b-slavov/Telerik-Software-Academy/blob/master/04.HTML%20Basics/04.Semantic-HTML/images/homework/1-refactoring.html) web page and make it HTML semantic.

### Problem 2. Student System
*	Create a web page using semantic HTML by the design.
*	Use some kind of approach to support old (non-HTML5-compatible) Web browsers like IE8.
