Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with 
information about the quality of the product or service under test. Software 
testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to 
allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software 
implementation. Test techniques include, but are not limited to, the process 
of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software 
bugs (errors or other defects).
